# OTel Python Lab

This is the companion repo for Module 6 of the O'Reilly Observability Fundamentals video course.

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **NOTE:** There is currently a bug that is preventing KinD from running in GitHub codespaces. To work around this, you can run this tutorial locally in VSCode using [dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial). I have opened this issue with the KinD folks in the hopes of getting some sort of resolution: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/3748.
